**Enhanced Security of LSB-Based Text and Image Steganography using AES Techniques**

This is an LSB (Least Significant Bit)-based image steganography using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Encryption Algorithm and Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Technique

In this project, a secret data or message is embedded in a cover image with the help of the LSB steganography technique and the AES cryptography algorithm, which is an NIST standard symmetric algorithm with a key length of 16 characters that is 256 bits to provide more security for the secret data or information. Based on our implementation of this algorithm using Python in a Visual Studio Code environment, the secret data embedded in a cover image is successfully retrieved using an AES encryption key, which can be shared with the receiver using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Technique, and the RGB pixel value of the cover image and the secret image is successfully extracted and saved.
