**Enhanced Security of LSB-Based Text and Image Steganography using AES Techniques**

This is a LSB(Least Significant Bit) based Image Steenography using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Encryption Algorithm and Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Technique

In this project, a secret data or message
is embedded in an cover image with the help of
LSB steganography technique and AES
cryptography algorithm, which is an NIST
standard symmetric algorithm with key length
of 16 character that is 256 bit to provide more
security for the secret data or information.
Based on our implementation of this algorithm
using Python in Visual Studio Code
environment the secret data embedded in an
cover image is successfully retrieved using an
aes encryption key and the RGB pixel value of
the cover image and the secret image is
successfully extracted and saved.
